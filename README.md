# VBA-challenge
VBA challenge for Data Analytics class


Click "Run Macro" button to loop through all the stocks for each quarter/sheet.

    It will show the quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter, 
    the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter, and the total stock volume of the stock.

    It will also show the stock with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume of the given quarter.

    Instead of using the conditional formatting option in Excel, I coded it into the VBA script to highlight positive and negative changes, and making a column into percentages.
    I did this way instead of what we did in the last assignment for conditional formatting, because we learned how to change the interior color of a cell in class using VBA.
    I also, with the help of the Xpert Learning Assistant, was able to code an entire column to show as percentages.

I used code provided by the course content and with the help of the Xpert Learning Assistant.
